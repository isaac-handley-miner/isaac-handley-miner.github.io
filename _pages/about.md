Hey I'm Isaac! I am a 3rd year PhD Student in Psychology at Boston College.

I'm interested in how people update their beliefs and how people reason about truth. For example, how are people's beliefs influenced by self-generated evidence (e.g., their own explanations)? How do people decide whether to classify a claim as true or false?

I'm also passionate about open science and interested in metascientific approaches to evaluating the methods used in psychology. I write about these topics on my [blog](https://isaac-handley-miner.github.io/year-archive/).

Before joining the [Morality Lab](https://moralitylab.bc.edu/) in Fall 2020, I received my B.A. in economics from [Hamilton College](https://www.hamilton.edu/) and worked as a lab manager in the [Mind and Body Lab](https://mbl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.

For example, some questions I'm interested in are:
- How are people's beliefs influenced by self-generated evidence (e.g., their own explanations)?
- How are people's beliefs influenced by social evidence (e.g., shifts in societal norms and beliefs)?
- How do people evaluate the credibility of information sources?
- How do people decide which claims to classify as true or false?
