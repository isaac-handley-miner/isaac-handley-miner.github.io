Hey I'm Isaac! I am a 3rd year PhD Student at Boston College.

I'm interested in how people think about the concept of truth, evaluate the credibility of information sources, and decide what information to trust. I'm also passionate about open science and interested in metascientific approaches to evaluating the methods used in psychology. Before joining the Morality Lab in Fall 2020, I received my B.A. in economics from Hamilton College and worked as a lab manager at Stanford University.
